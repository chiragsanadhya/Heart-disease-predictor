# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting heart disease based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to develop a predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset, excluding the "heart disease present" column, to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction).

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python source code files for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies for setting up the environment.
- `LICENSE`: The project's open-source license.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.
