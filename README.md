# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting heart disease based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to develop a predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset, excluding the "heart disease present" column, to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction).

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python source code files for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies for setting up the environment.
- `LICENSE`: The project's open-source license.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

4. Install the required Python packages:

5. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data analysis and model development.

6. You can also use the provided Python scripts in the `src/` directory for model training and prediction.
